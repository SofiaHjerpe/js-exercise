8. Reuse the `number1` and `number2` variables and create three new variables:
   - `result1` should contain the difference (subtraction) between the numbers
   - `result2` should contain the product (multiplication) of the two numbers
   - `result3` should contain the quotient (division) of the two numbers
   - Log them all to the console.
9. Create a variable `a` and assign it a value. Log it to the console. Now add 5 to `a` by reassigning the value of `a` by using the existing `a` and the number 5. Log it to the console.
10. What is the value of `a` in the console.log?

```js
let a = 10;
